# NetSathi Android Migration - Immediate Next Steps

## Quick Start Checklist

### Before You Begin
- [ ] Ensure you have a Windows/Mac/Linux development machine
- [ ] Have at least 8GB RAM and 50GB free disk space
- [ ] Stable internet connection for downloads

### Step 1: Development Environment (Start Here)
**Estimated Time: 2-3 hours**

1. **Install Android Studio**
   - [ ] Download from https://developer.android.com/studio
   - [ ] Install with default settings
   - [ ] Accept all SDK licenses
   - [ ] Create a virtual device (Pixel 4, API 30+)

2. **Install Node.js and React Native**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js (v16 or higher)
   # Download from https://nodejs.org/
   
   # Install React Native CLI
   npm install -g react-native-cli
   
   # Install React Native tools
   npm install -g @react-native-community/cli
   ```

3. **Test Your Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create test project
   npx react-native init TestApp
   cd TestApp
   
   # Run on Android
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

### Step 2: Create NetSathi Android Project
**Estimated Time: 1 hour**

```bash
# Create the project
npx react-native init NetSathiAndroid --template react-native-template-typescript
cd NetSathiAndroid

# Install essential dependencies
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
npm install react-native-voice react-native-tts
npm install react-native-permissions

# For Android specific setup
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
```

### Step 3: Basic Project Structure
**Estimated Time: 30 minutes**

Create these folders in your project:
```
src/
├── components/
├── screens/
├── services/
├── utils/
├── types/
└── constants/
```

### Step 4: First Milestone - Voice Test
**Goal: Get basic voice input/output working**

Create a simple screen that:
- [ ] Has a "Speak" button
- [ ] Records voice input
- [ ] Converts speech to text
- [ ] Speaks back the text

### Current Status Tracking

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npx react-native start

# Run on Android
npx react-native run-android

# Clean build
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd .. && npx react-native run-android

# Check React Native setup
npx react-native doctor

# Install new package
npm install <package-name>
# Then for native dependencies:
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

**Build Errors:**
1. Clean and rebuild: `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..`
2. Reset Metro cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
3. Check Android SDK path in Android Studio

**Emulator Issues:**
1. Restart emulator
2. Check if emulator is detected: `adb devices`
3. Try different API level (28, 29, 30)

**Permission Errors:**
1. Check AndroidManifest.xml for required permissions
2. Test on physical device if emulator has issues
3. Grant permissions manually in device settings

## Success Criteria for Phase 1
- [ ] Android Studio installed and working
- [ ] React Native project created successfully
- [ ] App runs on Android emulator/device
- [ ] Basic navigation between screens works
- [ ] Voice recording permission granted and working

**Target Completion:** Week 2
**Next Phase:** Core Feature Migration (Voice Services)
